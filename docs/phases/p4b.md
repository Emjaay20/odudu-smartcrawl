# P4b — theming and client branding

What the phase found while building it, in the shape `docs/phases/p4g.md`
follows. The phase's argument is in
[its design](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-27-p4b-theming-and-client-branding-design.md)
and [its plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-10-27-p4b-theming-and-client-branding.md).

Started 2026-10-27.

## Placement

The custom domain per tenant left P4b for a new phase, P4j, straight after it
(design section 3). P4j's 20–35 h is an estimate to refine in P4j's own
brainstorm. Liquid-style template logic went to the roadmap's "Decided against",
to be revisited when a user asks for it. P4b's own hours (81–134 h) are
unchanged and are set at the end of the phase from what the increments cost.

## The logout form's fields were outside its token

The confirmation form carried `client_id`, `post_logout_redirect_uri` and
`state` as hidden fields that the `csrf` value did not cover, so a form edited
after it was issued still verified. `SessionEntry.proof` now takes the bound
values, each length-prefixed, and the confirmation passes all three on issue and
verify. A caller that posts back only some of the fields now fails: the
plan-drive for the end-session path did, and was changed to post every hidden
field, and so did the front-channel transcript's request, which omitted
`client_id`. The decision is ADR 0047.
