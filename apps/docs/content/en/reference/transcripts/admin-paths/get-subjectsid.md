# `GET /subjects/:id`

Requires `view-users`, the same capability the listing does. Carries an
`ETag` computed over the response body, the same convention every other
single-resource read in this API follows; an unknown id answers `404`.

```bash
curl -sS -D - \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/admin/tenants/demo/subjects/01a0d6fd-9453-7bf0-9823-a5fc6ea34836
```
