description: "Reading a subject's profile requires view-users, and changing it requires manage-users."

# `GET /subjects/:id/profile` and `PATCH /subjects/:id/profile`

The read requires `view-users`, the write `manage-users`. Every OIDC
Core §5.1 claim column `users` carries, in the snake_case a claim itself
uses — `email_verified` and `phone_number_verified` beside them, both
writable here, and `profile_updated_at` last, stamped by the write and
never accepted from one. `email` and `username` are refused with `400`,
naming `PATCH /subjects/:id` above, which is the door that owns each; any
other member this schema does not carry is refused the same way, by ajv,
before either usecase runs. `If-Match` is optional, not mandatory: honoured
against a stale value with `412`, but never required with `428` the way a
replace-the-whole-list route requires it — a profile patches field by
field, so nothing here can reinstate what a concurrent write removed. An
id naming a service or `agent_instance` subject — one with no `users`
row — answers `404`, the same as one that does not exist at all.

**Submitting a different `phone_number` without also setting
`phone_number_verified` in the same request resets it to `false`.** A
different number is not a verified one — the same reasoning `updateEmail`
resets `email_verified` to `false` whenever `PATCH /subjects/:id` changes
the address. Resubmitting the same number — an echoed full-object
`PATCH`, say — leaves a verified flag exactly as it was.

After a further rebuild, in a tenant of its own, `profile-demo2`, on a fresh
subject `grace`:

```bash
curl -sS -D - \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/admin/tenants/profile-demo2/subjects/01a0e277-e90a-7876-926a-b433ce61d250/profile
```

`email_verified` is set the same way, against the address `PATCH
/subjects/:id` owns (a prior call there set it to `grace@example.com`):

`email` in the same body is refused, naming the route that owns it instead of
`about:blank`'s usual bare wording. In a tenant also named `profile-demo2`
created there for it, on its own `grace`

Submitting a different number, with no `phone_number_verified` in the

After re-verifying that same number, resubmitting it — an echoed
full-object `PATCH`, say, which carries `phone_number` on every call
whether or not it changed — leaves `phone_number_verified` exactly as it
was, because the submitted value is compared against the stored one, not
merely checked for presence:

```bash
curl -sS -D - -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone_number_verified": true}' \

The `ETag` and `profile_updated_at` are unchanged from the call before —
nothing was written at all, `phone_number` included, since the value it
carried was already there.

`amendProfile` computes the row's final state — this patch's values layered over
what is already there — before writing anything, so verifying a malformed number
is refused without ever reaching `users_verified_phone_is_e164` or writing a
number the caller asked to leave unverified. `isValidE164` mirrors that CHECK,
the same way `isValidBirthdate` mirrors `users_birthdate_shape`. On the `grace`
the `email` refusal above names:

```bash
curl -sS -D - -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone_number": "(415) 555-2671", "phone_number_verified": true}' \
